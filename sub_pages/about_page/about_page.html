        <p class="short-description">
            I am a PostDoctoral researcher with broad interest in ecological and climate economics, sustainability
            computational modelling and complexity science. I particularly focus on inequality and distributional analysis 
            as well as computational modelling at the intersection of economic and ecological systems. I employ, for example,
            input-output analysis, household-level data and agent-based modelling. 
        </p>

        <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            My interests are broad, but they centre around making the world a more sustainable and better place. 
            In all of my work, I try to emphasize quality over quantity. Every research piece I consider not only a contribution to science but also a little piece of "art". I believe this
            attitude helps to write with clarity, conduct analysis with rigor and come up with creative ideas - all as much as possible. 
            Moreover, I am very interested in quantitative, data-driven and computational methods. I think modelling helps structure ideas
            systematically and acts like a forcing function for the brain to focus properly and weed out superficial ideas from more solid ones.
            Empirical work is of course absolutely integral to science as a whole, and constitutes the ultimate bar any science has to pass.

        </p>
        <p> I work almost exclusively with Python these days and am very much for an open-source culture in science.</p>

        <p>
            I also belive that, in times of a "post-truth internet", in which emotion-driven narratives compete for setting the overall direction of society,
            scholars have a responsibility to focus on a fact-oriented and rational discourse to conribute to a bigger whole.
        </p>
        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I view teaching as an integral part of my job. First of all, there is no better way of learning than teaching. Science ultimatley profits from engaging with students
            and their "beginner-" or fresh perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teaching people how to think critically for themselves is what motivates me the most. Again, in today's world of 
            hyper-abundant information, fact and fiction, it is more important than ever for students to acquire "meta"-skills. This means for example
            learning to learn by themselves or understand first principles of methods and phenomena that can be applied across every-changing contexts.
